## USER STORY
``` 
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
## PERSONAL EVALUATION
Class defined most neccessary elements and styles used for this weeks assignment. Independent study was required and any research from outside
resources aided with shortcuts and easier understanding of the elements used. There wasn't much issues, a quick visit to the resources stated below and I've learned to fix the issues. I'm still trying to learn effective shortcuts for 
faster writing codes. Learned that HTML is the foundation, CSS is the styling, JavaScript is the functionality. A proper foundation
allows the following languages to prosper to the creativity of the developer.
